# VRMMRPROJECT
Indonesian Traditional Weapon Exhib

This project was created to fulfill the final assignment of the "Multimedia Mixed Reality" course. Using Unity 2019.4.4, this project implements Virtual Reality techniques.

For control, the project utilizes gaze interaction, where users can look at objects to interact with them. The implemented interaction involves displaying explanatory holograms next to traditional weapons.

There are two files included. The first file is the project package, which can be directly imported into Unity 2019.4.4. It also includes the APK file.
