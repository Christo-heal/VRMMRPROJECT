# VRMMRPROJECT
Indonesian Traditional Weapon Exhib

This project was created to fulfill the final assignment of the "Multimedia Mixed Reality" course. Using Unity 2019.4.4, this project implements Virtual Reality techniques.

For control, the project utilizes gaze interaction, where users can look at objects to interact with them. The implemented interaction involves displaying explanatory holograms next to traditional weapons.

There are two files included. The first file is the project package, which can be directly imported into Unity 2019.4.4. It also includes the APK file.

For convenience and to reduce the file size, I have converted all the source code into a Unity package. This way, you can easily view and access the code within Unity.

If you encounter any errors or have any questions regarding the package, please feel free to let me know.
