# VRMMRPROJECT
Indonesian Traditional Weapon Exhib

The Indonesian Traditional Weapon Exhibition project has been developed as part of the final assignment for the "Multimedia Mixed Reality" course. It leverages the capabilities of Unity 2019.4.4 to implement Virtual Reality techniques, providing an immersive experience for users.

In terms of user interaction, the project utilizes gaze interaction, a technique where users can interact with objects simply by directing their gaze toward them. In this particular project, the implemented interaction involves displaying explanatory holograms alongside Indonesian traditional weapons. This allows users to gain a deeper understanding of the weapons and their significance within the cultural context.

Included with this description are two files. The first file comprises the raw project, containing various test files that were utilized during the application's development phase but are not deemed necessary for the final version. These test files were used for experimentation and debugging purposes. On the other hand, the second file is a cleaned-up package that has been meticulously organized and stripped of any unnecessary test files. This streamlined version is ready for deployment and represents the final iteration of the project.

Furthermore, I have provided APK files that were built from scratch, allowing you to easily install and experience the Indonesian Traditional Weapon Exhibition on your device. Feel free to explore and engage with the immersive virtual reality environment to gain a deeper appreciation of Indonesian traditional weaponry.
